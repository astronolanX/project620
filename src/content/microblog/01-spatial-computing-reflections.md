Been diving deep into spatial computing interfaces lately. There's something fascinating about how our understanding of interaction changes when we move beyond the flat screen paradigm.

The challenge isn't just technical—it's fundamentally about rethinking the relationship between digital information and physical space. How do we make virtual objects feel tangible? How do we design for depth, for presence, for the full spectrum of human motion?

Working on some explorations that push beyond traditional UI patterns. More to share soon.
