The design tools we use shape the designs we create. Been thinking about how AI might change not just what we design, but how we think about the design process itself.

What if instead of designing screens, we designed systems of behavior? What if our tools understood intent, not just pixels?

Early experiments with generative design workflows are promising, but we're still in the "faster horses" phase. The real breakthroughs will come when we stop trying to automate existing processes and start imagining entirely new ones.
